A simple responsive mortgage calculator widget and shortcode.

== Description ==

The Responsive Mortgage Calculator is a jQuery widget and shortcode that's designed to fit easily into any theme, on any device, at any size. Just what every "Real Estate Agent on the go" needs. This plugin is, optionally, relying on [www.mlcalc.com/mortgage-calculator/](https://www.mlcalc.com/mortgage-calculator/ "Mortgage Calculator") service to show mortgage amortization and chart.

= Features =

The mortgage calculator allows your website visitors to estimate their mortgage payments by entering:

* the total cost of the home,
* a down payment amount,
* an interest rate (fixed rate),
* the amortization period (mortgage term),
* and they can select a payment period, either monthly, bi-weekly, or weekly,
* nice popup summary with chart and amortization schedule.

The mortgage payment result is displayed below the form - very simply and very easy to follow. For the savvy user, a click on the information icon reveals more mortgage details…

= Redesign It =

There are settings to adjust the styling, a light and a dark theme, or you can remove the styling entirely and use your theme’s styling. The HTML is built with plenty of classes, so it’s easy to override the included stylesheet with your own CSS. 

= Plenty of Options =

* Set the interest rate compounding period for your region.
* Format currencies how you want with your own symbol, ISO code and number format.
* Hide the down payment field.
* Set a default interest rate.
* Accept amortization period in months or years.
* Set a fixed payment period.
* Set available mortgage payment period options.
* Rename the input labels.
* Add your own CSS classes.

= Shortcode Attributes =

Use the shortcode on different pages with different field names by using shortcode attributes. They’re pretty obvious, but here’s an example:

`[mortgagecalculator totalamount="Mortgage Amount"]`

or use the first letter of the original labels:

`[rmc ta="Mortgage Amount"]`

Set input values using attributes for total amount, down payment, interest rate, and mortgage term the long way:

`[mortgagecalculator total_amount_value="$250,000" down_payment_value="$50,000" interest_rate_value="3.49%" amortization_period_value="15 years"]`

or using the short versions:

`[rmc tav="$250,000" dpv="$50,000" irv="3.49%" apv="15 years"]`

= Disclaimer =

The Responsive Mortgage Calculator is for demonstration purposes only and may not reflect actual numbers for your mortgage.

== Installation ==

Install this plugin just like any other…

1. Upload the plugin folder `responsive-mortgage-calculator.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

= Widget Installation =

1. Access the `Widgets` page under the `Appearance` menu.
1. Drag the `Responsive Mortgage Calculator` into the Widget display area of your choice.
1. If you want, change the title and save it.

= Shortcode Usage =

You can insert the mortgage calculator into a page or post using the short code `[mortgagecalculator]` or `[rmc]`.

= Set the Compounding Period =

The mortgage calculator has a default compounding period that is semi-annual. Visit the settings page under `Settings` > `Resp Mortgage Calculator` and change the setting ‘Compounding period for the mortgage interest’ to the correct period for your region.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= On submission, the page just reloads and the mortgage calculator shows no results =

This is likely a problem with the JavaScript file not being loaded, and seems to occur when using the shortcode with a visual editor plugin, like Visual Composer. This will also prevent the CSS file from loading.

First, try editing the page with the shortcode. Switch from the visual editor to plain text editing, add the shortcode in plain text, and save it. Check the mortgage calculator to see if it working. If that didn’t work, you can…

Solve this problem by manually loading the scripts and styles. In the plugin folder, open the `Extras` folder, then open the file called `manually_load_scripts.php`. Copy the contents to your theme’s functions.php file. Even better, copy it to the functions.php file of a child theme. Change the page slug in the `if` conditional from `your-page-slug-here` to the actual page slug you’re using for the shortcode. Test it.

= The calculated payment is off by a few dollars =

The mortgage calculator calculates interest monthly by default, but you can change this on the settings page. Go to `Settings` > `Resp Mortgage Calculator` and change the setting ‘Compounding Period’ to the correct period for your region.

= When I put two mortgage calculators on the same page, it doesn't work =

This is a known issue. In the current version of the calculator, there can only be one instance of Responsive Mortgage Calculator on a page. This may change at some point in the future.

== Screenshots ==

1. The mortgage calculator fits in the widgets area of your theme or on any page and blends right in. The form inputs are styled simply and unobtrusively. The ‘Calculate’ button takes it’s styling from your theme.
2. The mortgage payment amount is displayed below the ‘Calculate’ button. The circled chart icon is clickable.
3. A longer summary of the mortgage details can be shown by changing appropriate setting.
